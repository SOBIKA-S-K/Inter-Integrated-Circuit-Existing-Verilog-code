# Inter-Integrated-Circuit-Existing-Verilog-code
An Inter-Integrated Circuit (IÂ²C) existing Verilog code implements master-slave communication using serial data (SDA) and clock (SCL) lines. It handles START, ADDRESS, DATA, ACK, and STOP sequences in a synchronous manner, enabling data exchange between a controller and multiple peripherals.
